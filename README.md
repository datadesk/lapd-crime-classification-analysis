# Checking the LAPD's crime classifications

The Times analyzed Los Angeles Police Department violent crime data from 2005 to 2012. Our analysis found that the Los Angeles Police Department misclassified an estimated 14,000 serious assaults as minor offenses, artificially lowering the city’s crime levels.

This repository has an [ipython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) file to [demonstrate how we used two machine learning classifiers](https://github.com/datadesk/lapd-crime-classification-analysis/blob/master/classifiers.ipynb) to analyze more than 400,000 crimes -- records we obtained through a California public records request. We have also released two small slices of data we used to [train](https://github.com/datadesk/lapd-crime-classification-analysis/blob/master/training_data.csv) and [test](https://github.com/datadesk/lapd-crime-classification-analysis/blob/master/test_data.csv) our models.
